# Info

I would call myself a beginner with BASH. I did this script in my free time, apart from school. If you'd like to improve the two scripts, feel free to do it üòÑ

# Planned improvements

- More interactivity!
    - Which Container should be Dumped/Restored
    - Username
    - Database-Name
    - etc...
- Custom File Paths
- Saving the Parameters to a file, so the Scripts don't forget them
- and much more!
