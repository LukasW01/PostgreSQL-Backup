# PostgreSQL-Backup

Two bash scripts to Dump/Restore a PostgreSQL-Database within a Docker-Container üêã

Please note that **I** am not a professional with Bash. Feel free to commit your code and improve this Script.

# Usage

**Download the File/s**

wget <https://github.com/>  

**Give Executive permissions**

chmod +x <file.sh>

**Execute Script with Root**

./<file.sh>


# Planned improvements

- More interactivty!
    - Which Container should be Dumped/Restored
    - Username
    - Database-Name
    - etc...
- Custom File Paths
- Check if the Restore/Dump was sucessfull (for now the skript just asumes that the dump was succesful)
- and much more!
