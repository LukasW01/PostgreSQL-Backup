# PostgreSQL-Backup

Two bash scripts to Dump/Restore a PostgreSQL-Database within a Docker-Container 🐋

# Usage

**Download the File/s**

wget <https://github.com/>  

**Give Executive permissions**

chmod +x <file.sh>

**Execute Script with Root**

./<file.sh>

# Info

I would call myself a beginner with BASH. I did this script in my free time, apart from school. If you'd like to improve the two scripts, feel free to do it 😄

# Planned improvements

- More interactivity!
    - Which Container should be Dumped/Restored
    - Username
    - Database-Name
    - etc...
- Custom File Paths
- Saving the Parameters to a file, so the Scripts don't forget them
- and much more!
